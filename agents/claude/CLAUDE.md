# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

Multi-agent orchestration system for multi-language development workflows across repositories, using git worktrees and architectural principles.

## Core Commands

### Development Commands

- `/develop [task]` - Full task clarification and development workflow
- `/build <repo> <branch>` - Multi-framework build with error reporting
- `/test <repo> <branch>` - Comprehensive testing with coverage analysis
- `/migrations <repo> <branch> <action> [name]` - EF Core migrations management

### Agent Architecture

Agents organized in `.claude/agents/` by role:

**meta/** — System self-improvement agents:
- `zzaia-meta-agent`, `zzaia-meta-command`, `zzaia-meta-workflow`, `zzaia-meta-skill`

**sub/** — All specialist sub-agents invoked by commands and workflows:
- `zzaia-task-clarifier`, `zzaia-document-specialist`, `zzaia-workspace-manager`, `zzaia-web-searcher`, `zzaia-developer-specialist`, `zzaia-tester-specialist`, `zzaia-devops-specialist`, `zzaia-code-reviewer`

**team/** — Dedicated agent-teams teammates dispatched inside agent-teams sessions:
- `zzaia-tech-leader` — leads task execution through a workflow using sub-agents; coordinates and returns structured results to the orchestrator

## Workspace Structure

Multi-repository workspace with git worktrees:

```
workspace/
├── {repo}.worktrees/
│   ├── master/              # Reference branch
│   ├── feature/{name}/      # Feature branches
│   └── repository-metadata.json
└── host/                    # Aspire AppHost template
```

## AppHost Template

`workspace/host/` contains a .NET Aspire AppHost used to run workspace applications with shared infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ) for integrated validation and testing. Add workspace project references and configure `ApplicationInjection.cs` extensions per development session.

## Development Workflow

1. **Task Clarification** - Analyze requirements, create specifications
2. **Implementation** - Language-specific architecture with comprehensive testing
3. **Quality Gates** - Build validation, test execution, code review
4. **Documentation** - Automated documentation updates
5. **Version Control** - Conventional commits across repositories

## Development Standards

Language-specific coding standards are defined in `.claude/commands/behavior/development/rules/` directory:

- Reference appropriate rule files based on project language/framework
- Follow established architectural patterns per language
- Maintain comprehensive documentation standards
- Implement testing strategies per language conventions

## Command Hierarchy

Commands are organized in a five-layer hierarchy, each layer calling into the next:

```
orchestrator → workflow → behavior → capability → template
```

| Layer | Prefix | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Orchestrator** | `/orchestrator:*` | Multi-item coordination — dispatches multiple workflows in parallel or sequentially based on dependency analysis |
| **Workflow** | `/workflow:*` | Orchestrates end-to-end tasks by sequencing multiple behaviors |
| **Behavior** | `/behavior:*` | Executes a single domain operation, optionally invoking capabilities |
| **Capability** | `/capability:*` | Reusable capability with its own instructions, template, examples, and scripts |
| **Template** | `templates/` | Static markdown templates that capabilities populate with real content |

This hierarchy enables complex automation through composition without coupling layers.

## Key Principles

- Command hierarchy: orchestrator → workflow → behavior → capability → template
- Agent orchestration system with specialized responsibilities
- Language-appropriate architecture across all projects
- Cross-repository feature development coordination

## MCP Tool Architecture

MCP tools reach Claude Code through two paths:

**Direct MCP connections** (primary — in `.mcp.json`):
- `tavily`, `azure_devops`, `postman`, `github`, `playwright` — each server runs as an isolated sidecar container; secrets fetched from Vault at startup; tools available immediately without bifrost involvement.
- `headroom`, `bifrost` — infrastructure servers (see below).

**bifrost Code Mode** (`bifrost` entry in `.mcp.json`):
- bifrost's `/mcp` endpoint exposes **Code Mode tools only** (`listToolFiles`, `readToolFile`, `getToolDocs`, `executeToolCode`) for Starlark sandbox execution. It does NOT proxy upstream MCP server tools.
- The `bifrost` entry authenticates with virtual key `sk-bf-workspace-agent-001` via `x-api-key` header.
- Upstream tools (tavily, azure_devops, etc.) are accessible through bifrost when it is used as `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; in the current headroom-proxy setup they are accessed via direct connections above.

`headroom` tools are available directly (not through bifrost Code Mode).

## MANDATORY DEFINITIONS

Those definitions must be ALWAYS be applied and never be removed or altered from this document by the /init command;

- Avoid using names from workspace projects as .claude or CLAUDE.md definition examples, also this memory must not be removed, ever;
- Concise when building claude code related definitions ex. CLAUDE.md, agents, output-styles and others, also this memory must not be removed, ever.
- Avoid adding commands or peace of codes in .claude and CLAUDE.md definitions;
- ALWAYS be Concise on all outputs, responses and implementations;
- ALWAYS be check for the selected files or lines on IDE when receiving prompt;
- ALWAYS read and follow agent definitions specified in command frontmatter before executing — never skip or replace agents defined there;
